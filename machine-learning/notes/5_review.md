# Notes 1-4 Review

## Note 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?
- **Definition**:
  - A field of computer science that enables systems to learn patterns from data rather than being explicitly programmed.

- **Goal**:
  - Build models that generalize well to unseen data.

### Types of Machine Learning

| Type | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Supervised Learning | Learn from labeled data (input + known output) | Predicting house prices, email spam detection |
| Unsupervised Learning | Learn from unlabeled data (input only) | Customer segmentation, topic modeling |
| Reinforcement Learning | Learn by interacting with environment via rewards | Training a robot, playing chess |

### Common Terms
- **Training Data** -> used to build the model
- **Testing Data** -> used to evaluate model
- **Features (X)** -> input variables
- **Labels (Y)** -> output variable (target)

### Supervised Learning Tasks
- **Classification** -> predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam vs not spam)
- **Regression** -> predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices)
