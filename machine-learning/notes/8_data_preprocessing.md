# Data Preprocessing

- **Sampling** -> taking a smaller representative chunk of your dataset
- **Discretization and Binarization** -> converting numeric or categorical values into forms that algorithms can use more easily
- **Feature subset selection and transformation** -> reducing irrelevant data and modifying features to be more useful
