# Supervised Learning: Classification

## Classification
- task of assigning objects to one of several predefined categories also known as class
- **Goal:** finding a model to map each attribute to a predefined class, so that we can use this model on new records to assign them to a class as accurately as possible in future

## Terminology

- a **dataset** is a collection of data objects
  - an object is also known as: **instance**, **record**, **point**, case, sample, entity

<br />

- an **attribute** is a property or characteristic of an object
  - ***Examples***: eye color of a person, temperature, etc.
  - attribute is also know as variable, field, characteristic, dimension, or feature

<br />

- a *target concept* is the function to be learned
  - inference of the concept from the training instances so that it maps inputs with outputs

<br />

- a _training set_ is the set of <mark> instances that are used to figure out the target concept </mark>
  - includes the ==inputs and outputs== pairs
