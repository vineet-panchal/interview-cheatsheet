# Introduction To Machine Learning

- machine learning is about teaching a computer to become intelligent, by learning over time based on data and experience.

## Supervised Learning
- task of learning a mapping between a set of inputs to a set of outputs
- Problem of Induction: we go from specific examples to a more general rule

#### Example: 
```
1 -> 1
2 -> 4
3 -> 9
4 -> 16
5 -> 25
6 -> 36
```

## Unsupervised Learning
- task of describing patterns in the data and how to divide it
- we only have inputs, and no longer have the output

## Reinforcement Learning
- learning based on rewarding for desired behaviours and punishing for undesired ones
