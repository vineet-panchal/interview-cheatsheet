# Understanding Cloud Computing Services

## MODULE 1: What are cloud services and how are they modeled?

### A look to the future

###### - In recent years, many businesses have been moving their operational work to the cloud. 
###### - For example, businesses might store their employee data and use that data to run payroll systems in the cloud. An individual computational task like running payroll is called a workload.
###### - Moving common workloads to the cloud enables businesses to: save money, scale based on business needs, and accelerate innovation

### Artificial intelligence and the cloud

###### - In the 1950s, computer scientist and mathematician Alan Turing developed a test to determine if a computer was “thinking” similarly to the way humans think. 
###### - The test was simple: if 30% of humans who conversed with the machine couldn’t tell if it was a machine or a human, the machine passed the test. 
###### - The test became known as the Turing test(opens in a new tab). 
###### - It took until 2014 for computer engineers to develop a computer that could pass the test!  
###### - Machines that can process information in a way that mimics or imitates human thinking are said to be intelligent
###### - Because the intelligence isn’t human, scientists have called this kind of thinking ability as artificial intelligence (AI). 

| Technology | Application | Description | 
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Image Recognition | Medical Diagnosis | Doctors use AI to help them analyze medical images and patient data to better diagnose issues and plan treatments. | 
| | National Security | Security and governmental agencies use AI image recognition to help keep people secure. It can analyze and recognize images, enabling engineers to develop facial recognition, and objet detection programs. |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Virtual Assistants | Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use NLP. One day, humans will interact with these tools as they would with another person. |
| | Chatbots | Businesses are deploying chatbots to provide customer support and answer questions in natural language and in real time by using NLP. |
| Real-time data analysis | Gaming | Game developers are using AI in video games to create realistic opponents and adapt to the player’s behavior. |
| Deep Learning | Recommendation Systems | Companies use AI to analyze customer behavior to help them more easily find products and services they need and prefer. Examples include Netflix movie recommendations and Amazon product recommendations. |
| | Fraud Detection | AI systems can analyze data and threat actor behavior to identify fraudulent behavior and patterns. Credit card companies use these systems to help identify fraudulent credit card usage while not restricting their customers from using their cards when they need them. |
