# Developing and Deploying Software in the Cloud

## MODULE 1: Developing software in the cloud

### Software development in the cloud
###### - Software development is the process of creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software
###### - Software is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. And from a user perspective, software is the applications they use to perform their tasks
###### - Software developers can work in different ways, and one of the most popular and efficient methods is cloud-based development

###### - Cloud-based development involves cloud computing to develop software
###### - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet

###### - Cloud computing offers many benefits for software development. The benefits include the following.

##### Scalability
###### ==> Cloud computing allows developers to easily adjust the number of resources they need for their software projects, depending on the demand and workload
###### ==> This means they can scale up or down without worrying about buying or maintaining hardware.

##### Cost-efficiency
###### ==> Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront investment and reduces the ongoing costs of software development. Developers only pay for what they use
###### ==> They can also access a variety of services and tools at a lower price than traditional development methods

##### Collaboration
###### ==> Cloud computing enables developers to work together from anywhere in the world
###### ==> They use cloud-based platforms and tools that facilitate communication, coordination, and integration
###### ==> Developers can also share code, data, and feedback with other stakeholders in real time.

###### ==> Cloud computing provides developers with access to the latest technologies and innovations in the software industry
###### ==> Including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT)
###### ==> Developers use these technologies to create more advanced and intelligent software solutions

#### Cloud-based development versus traditional development

##### Development environment
###### ==> In traditional software development, developers use a development environment on a local computer
###### ==> This is likely to consist of the computer, an operating system (OS), a programming language, an integrated development environment (IDE), and other tools
###### ==> In cloud-based development, developers use a cloud-based development environment
###### ==> This is likely to consist of a browser, a cloud service provider, a cloud platform or framework, and other tools
###### ==> This enables developers to work from any device that has an internet connection anywhere in the world

##### Development cycle
###### ==> In traditional software development, developers follow a linear development cycle that consists of phases such as planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
###### ==> In cloud-based development, developers follow an iterative development cycle that consists of short and frequent iterations involving planning, coding, testing, and deploying
###### ==> An iterative development cycle is also known as an agile development cycle. This results in faster deployment of new and updated apps to users

##### Development model
###### ==> In traditional software development, developers use a monolithic or centralized development model that consists of building one large software application that runs on a single server or a private network
###### ==> In cloud-based development, developers use a microservices model
###### ==> This is a distributed development model where developers build multiple small software applications that run on multiple servers or a public network
###### ==> This enables faster development, easier deployment, and more flexible scaling of applications


### Developer operations (DevOps) in the cloud
###### - Developer operations or DevOps is a culture and practice of collaboration between developers and operations teams
###### - It’s a software development approach that combines collaborative principles, tools, and practices to enable frequent updates and rapid evolution of products
###### - DevOps originated in on-premises development environments
###### - Teams using traditional DevOps strategies can face challenges, such as: Limited scalability, Reliability, Cost-efficiency of their infrastructure, Lack of standardization and automation of their processes, Difficulty sharing knowledge and best practices across their teams

###### - But cloud computing technology helps businesses overcome these limitations
###### - DevOps on the cloud gives businesses a centralized, standard platform to manage and automate their infrastructure, data, and security

###### - Using cloud-based DevOps tools and technologies can bring many benefits to a software development team

##### Multiple environments
###### ==> Cloud-based DevOps platforms allow developers to create and test applications on various environments without having to worry about the underlying hardware or software

###### - Teams can use the cloud DevOps features to review, integrate, and build code with effective code reviews, pull requests, and automated builds.
###### - Teams can use the cloud DevOps resources to test and ship applications with confidence. Resources can include manual and exploratory testing tools, release management processes, and automated gates.

###### - DevOps in the cloud is a way of developing and delivering software applications that uses the cloud’s advantages to support agile work processes, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and cloud security operations
###### - It differs from traditional DevOps by offering more scalability, reliability, cost-efficiency, standardization, automation, collaboration, and learning opportunities for developers and operations teams


### Best practices for cloud software development
###### - Cloud software development is the process of creating and delivering software applications that run on remote servers and users access over the internet
###### - Cloud software development has many benefits, such as scalability, reliability, security, and cost-efficiency
###### - However, it also presents some challenges, such as data privacy, compliance, performance, and integration
###### - So, to ensure the quality and success of their projects, cloud software developers should consider the following best practices

##### Plan for portability
###### ==> Cloud software should not be dependent on a specific cloud provider or platform. It should be able to run on different environments and adapt to changing requirements
###### ==> Developers can make cloud software portable by using standard protocols, data formats, and design patterns

##### Use serverless computing
###### ==> Serverless computing is a way of developing cloud software without having to manage servers or infrastructure
###### ==> Instead, cloud providers can handle the scaling, provisioning, and maintenance of the resources running the application
###### ==> Serverless computing can reduce costs, improve performance, and simplify development

##### Choose the appropriate design
###### ==> Cloud software can have different architectures and designs depending on the goals and needs of the application
###### ==> Some common design choices are microservices, serverless, and hybrid
###### ==> Each design has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to evaluate them carefully before choosing one

##### Provide security
###### ==> Cloud software should follow security best practices to protect data and resources from unauthorized access or malicious attacks
###### ==> Developers can make their cloud software more secure by using encryption, authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring, and auditing.
###### ==> Developers should consider security at every stage of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment to maintenance

##### Consider different IT environments
###### ==> Cloud software should be able to run on different IT environments, such as development, testing, staging, and production
###### ==> Each environment might have different configurations, data sets, and requirements.
###### ==> Developers should design and deploy their cloud software in a way that allows for easy and consistent transitions between these environments

### The software development lifecycle (SDLC) in the cloud
###### - The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software
###### - SDLC helps software developers plan, design, develop, test, and deploy software in a systematic and efficient way
###### - Software development teams build software using this model by going through these steps repeatedly until the software development is complete

##### Part 1: Plan
###### ==> In this phase, you define your business goals, requirements, specifications, and risks for your software development project
###### ==> You also decide which cloud service provider and platform you will use for your project

##### Part 2: Design
###### ==> In this phase, you analyze your requirements and design the architecture and structure of your software
###### ==> You also choose the technologies, tools, and frameworks you will use for your software development project

##### Step 3: Develop
###### ==> In this phase, you write the code for your software using the chosen technologies, tools, and frameworks
###### ==> You also integrate your code with other modules or components of your software

##### Step 4: Test
###### ==> In this phase, you test your software for errors, bugs, and quality
###### ==> You use both manual and automated testing methods to ensure that your software meets the requirements and expectations of your customers

##### Step 5: Deploy
###### ==> In this phase, you release your software to the cloud environment where it will run. You also monitor and manage its performance, availability, security, and updates


## MODULE 2: Orchestrating software in the cloud

### Orchestrating software development on the cloud

***Orchestration is a way of managing and automating the different tasks and processes involved in running applications and workloads.***

###### - Cloud orchestration is orchestrating applications and workloads running on one or more cloud platforms
###### - The cloud platforms might be public, like IBM Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Azure. Or, they might be private, like a corporate data center
###### - Cloud orchestration helps developers coordinate multiple components of their cloud environment and make sure they work together to achieve a specific goal, like deploying or updating an app. These components might be servers, storage, network, security, or software

***Automation is the process of using software to perform tasks that would otherwise require human intervention, such as sending emails, updating databases, or testing applications.***

###### - Cloud automation is a type of software automation that runs on cloud platforms, which are online services that provide computing resources and storage
###### - Cloud automation has several advantages over traditional software automation, such as scalability, reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness
###### - Cloud automation can help businesses and organizations improve their efficiency, productivity, and innovation by automating various processes and workflows in the cloud

| Cloud Automation | Cloud Orchestration |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Cloud automation is the process of performing operations on components of a cloud environment without human intervention. For example, a developer might automate the creation of a virtual machine (VM) or the configuration of a firewall. Cloud automation is like a building block that developers use to create more complex and interconnected tasks. | Cloud orchestration is the process of arranging and connecting these building blocks into a workflow that performs a specific business function. For example, a developer might orchestrate the deployment of an app by automating the steps of creating VMs, installing software, configuring network settings, and testing the app. |

#### Cloud orchestration methods
###### - There are different methods that developers can use for cloud orchestration, depending on the needs of their project. You can divide cloud orchestration methods into two categories:
###### ==> Imperative orchestration methods, in which developers specify the exact steps and order of execution for their automation tasks.
###### ==> Declarative orchestration methods, in which developers specify the desired outcome and let the tool they are using figure out the best way to achieve that outcome


### The imperative orchestration method
###### - In imperative cloud orchestration, developers specify the exact steps and commands to execute to achieve a certain goal
###### - For example, to deploy an application on a cloud platform, they need to write a script or a workflow that tells the cloud orchestration tool what to do in each step, such as creating a virtual machine, installing software, and then configuring settings

##### 1. Provision a server on a public cloud service
##### 2. Configure the network settings and security policies
##### 3. Install the required software and dependencies
##### 4. Deploy an application on the server
##### 5. Start the server and monitor its performance

###### - Imperative cloud orchestration gives a developer control and flexibility over the process, but it also requires more knowledge and skills to write and maintain the scripts or workflows
###### - Developers will also need to update the orchestration whenever there are changes in the cloud environment or the application requirements
###### - The imperative method can provide you with distinct benefits if your deployment approach calls for it. Consider these two advantages. 

###### ==> Control: By using the imperative approach, you have more control over the process. When deploying a new service, more control can help you ensure things go the way you intend. 
###### ==> Specific steps: When deploying a new service, you might want to create very specific steps so you are sure the service does exactly what you want it to do
