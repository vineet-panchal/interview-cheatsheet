# Developing and Deploying Software in the Cloud

## MODULE 1: Developing software in the cloud

### Software development in the cloud
###### - Software development is the process of creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software
###### - Software is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. And from a user perspective, software is the applications they use to perform their tasks
###### - Software developers can work in different ways, and one of the most popular and efficient methods is cloud-based development

###### - Cloud-based development involves cloud computing to develop software
###### - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet

###### - Cloud computing offers many benefits for software development. The benefits include the following.

##### Scalability
###### ==> Cloud computing allows developers to easily adjust the number of resources they need for their software projects, depending on the demand and workload
###### ==> This means they can scale up or down without worrying about buying or maintaining hardware.

##### Cost-efficiency
###### ==> Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront investment and reduces the ongoing costs of software development. Developers only pay for what they use
###### ==> They can also access a variety of services and tools at a lower price than traditional development methods

##### Collaboration
###### ==> Cloud computing enables developers to work together from anywhere in the world
###### ==> They use cloud-based platforms and tools that facilitate communication, coordination, and integration
###### ==> Developers can also share code, data, and feedback with other stakeholders in real time.

##### Innovation
###### ==> Cloud computing provides developers with access to the latest technologies and innovations in the software industry
###### ==> Including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT)
###### ==> Developers use these technologies to create more advanced and intelligent software solutions

#### Cloud-based development versus traditional development

##### Development environment
###### ==> In traditional software development, developers use a development environment on a local computer
###### ==> This is likely to consist of the computer, an operating system (OS), a programming language, an integrated development environment (IDE), and other tools
###### ==> In cloud-based development, developers use a cloud-based development environment
###### ==> This is likely to consist of a browser, a cloud service provider, a cloud platform or framework, and other tools
###### ==> This enables developers to work from any device that has an internet connection anywhere in the world

##### Development cycle
###### ==> In traditional software development, developers follow a linear development cycle that consists of phases such as planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
###### ==> In cloud-based development, developers follow an iterative development cycle that consists of short and frequent iterations involving planning, coding, testing, and deploying
###### ==> An iterative development cycle is also known as an agile development cycle. This results in faster deployment of new and updated apps to users

##### Development model
###### ==> In traditional software development, developers use a monolithic or centralized development model that consists of building one large software application that runs on a single server or a private network
###### ==> In cloud-based development, developers use a microservices model
###### ==> This is a distributed development model where developers build multiple small software applications that run on multiple servers or a public network
###### ==> This enables faster development, easier deployment, and more flexible scaling of applications


### Developer operations (DevOps) in the cloud
###### - Developer operations or DevOps is a culture and practice of collaboration between developers and operations teams
###### - It’s a software development approach that combines collaborative principles, tools, and practices to enable frequent updates and rapid evolution of products
###### - DevOps originated in on-premises development environments
###### - Teams using traditional DevOps strategies can face challenges, such as: Limited scalability, Reliability, Cost-efficiency of their infrastructure, Lack of standardization and automation of their processes, Difficulty sharing knowledge and best practices across their teams

###### - But cloud computing technology helps businesses overcome these limitations
###### - DevOps on the cloud gives businesses a centralized, standard platform to manage and automate their infrastructure, data, and security

###### - Using cloud-based DevOps tools and technologies can bring many benefits to a software development team

##### Multiple environments
###### ==> Cloud-based DevOps platforms allow developers to create and test applications on various environments without having to worry about the underlying hardware or software

##### Continuous, agile process
###### ==> By using cloud-based DevOps tools, teams have access to faster feedback loops, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and agile work processes

##### Valuable tools
###### ==> Cloud-based DevOps platforms provide tools and services for automating and managing the deployment and configuration of applications and infrastructure, as well as monitoring and troubleshooting performance and security issues

##### Better delivery
###### ==> Cloud-based DevOps offers development teams a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective way of delivering software applications to customers

###### - In addition to the infrastructure benefits, using cloud-based DevOps tools and services can also have a positive impact on team culture.
###### - Using cloud-based DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration and learning among developers and operations teams.
###### - DevOps teams can take advantage of cloud functionality to plan, track, and discuss work across their teams.
###### - Teams can use the cloud DevOps features to review, integrate, and build code with effective code reviews, pull requests, and automated builds.
###### - Teams can use the cloud DevOps resources to test and ship applications with confidence. Resources can include manual and exploratory testing tools, release management processes, and automated gates.

###### - DevOps in the cloud is a way of developing and delivering software applications that uses the cloud’s advantages to support agile work processes, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and cloud security operations
###### - It differs from traditional DevOps by offering more scalability, reliability, cost-efficiency, standardization, automation, collaboration, and learning opportunities for developers and operations teams


### Best practices for cloud software development
###### - Cloud software development is the process of creating and delivering software applications that run on remote servers and users access over the internet
###### - Cloud software development has many benefits, such as scalability, reliability, security, and cost-efficiency
###### - However, it also presents some challenges, such as data privacy, compliance, performance, and integration
###### - So, to ensure the quality and success of their projects, cloud software developers should consider the following best practices

##### Plan for portability
###### ==> Cloud software should not be dependent on a specific cloud provider or platform. It should be able to run on different environments and adapt to changing requirements
###### ==> Developers can make cloud software portable by using standard protocols, data formats, and design patterns

##### Use serverless computing
###### ==> Serverless computing is a way of developing cloud software without having to manage servers or infrastructure
###### ==> Instead, cloud providers can handle the scaling, provisioning, and maintenance of the resources running the application
###### ==> Serverless computing can reduce costs, improve performance, and simplify development

##### Choose the appropriate design
###### ==> Cloud software can have different architectures and designs depending on the goals and needs of the application
###### ==> Some common design choices are microservices, serverless, and hybrid
###### ==> Each design has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to evaluate them carefully before choosing one

##### Provide security
###### ==> Cloud software should follow security best practices to protect data and resources from unauthorized access or malicious attacks
###### ==> Developers can make their cloud software more secure by using encryption, authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring, and auditing.
###### ==> Developers should consider security at every stage of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment to maintenance

##### Consider different IT environments
###### ==> Cloud software should be able to run on different IT environments, such as development, testing, staging, and production
###### ==> Each environment might have different configurations, data sets, and requirements.
###### ==> Developers should design and deploy their cloud software in a way that allows for easy and consistent transitions between these environments

### The software development lifecycle (SDLC) in the cloud
###### - The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software
###### - SDLC helps software developers plan, design, develop, test, and deploy software in a systematic and efficient way
###### - Software development teams build software using this model by going through these steps repeatedly until the software development is complete

##### Part 1: Plan
###### ==> In this phase, you define your business goals, requirements, specifications, and risks for your software development project
###### ==> You also decide which cloud service provider and platform you will use for your project

##### Part 2: Design
###### ==> In this phase, you analyze your requirements and design the architecture and structure of your software
###### ==> You also choose the technologies, tools, and frameworks you will use for your software development project

##### Step 3: Develop
###### ==> In this phase, you write the code for your software using the chosen technologies, tools, and frameworks
###### ==> You also integrate your code with other modules or components of your software

##### Step 4: Test
###### ==> In this phase, you test your software for errors, bugs, and quality
###### ==> You use both manual and automated testing methods to ensure that your software meets the requirements and expectations of your customers

##### Step 5: Deploy
###### ==> In this phase, you release your software to the cloud environment where it will run. You also monitor and manage its performance, availability, security, and updates


## MODULE 2: Orchestrating software in the cloud

### Orchestrating software development on the cloud

***Orchestration is a way of managing and automating the different tasks and processes involved in running applications and workloads.***

###### - Cloud orchestration is orchestrating applications and workloads running on one or more cloud platforms
###### - The cloud platforms might be public, like IBM Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Azure. Or, they might be private, like a corporate data center
###### - Cloud orchestration helps developers coordinate multiple components of their cloud environment and make sure they work together to achieve a specific goal, like deploying or updating an app. These components might be servers, storage, network, security, or software

***Automation is the process of using software to perform tasks that would otherwise require human intervention, such as sending emails, updating databases, or testing applications.***

###### - Cloud automation is a type of software automation that runs on cloud platforms, which are online services that provide computing resources and storage
###### - Cloud automation has several advantages over traditional software automation, such as scalability, reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness
###### - Cloud automation can help businesses and organizations improve their efficiency, productivity, and innovation by automating various processes and workflows in the cloud

| Cloud Automation | Cloud Orchestration |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Cloud automation is the process of performing operations on components of a cloud environment without human intervention. For example, a developer might automate the creation of a virtual machine (VM) or the configuration of a firewall. Cloud automation is like a building block that developers use to create more complex and interconnected tasks. | Cloud orchestration is the process of arranging and connecting these building blocks into a workflow that performs a specific business function. For example, a developer might orchestrate the deployment of an app by automating the steps of creating VMs, installing software, configuring network settings, and testing the app. |

#### Cloud orchestration methods
###### - There are different methods that developers can use for cloud orchestration, depending on the needs of their project. You can divide cloud orchestration methods into two categories:
###### ==> Imperative orchestration methods, in which developers specify the exact steps and order of execution for their automation tasks.
###### ==> Declarative orchestration methods, in which developers specify the desired outcome and let the tool they are using figure out the best way to achieve that outcome


### The imperative orchestration method
###### - In imperative cloud orchestration, developers specify the exact steps and commands to execute to achieve a certain goal
###### - For example, to deploy an application on a cloud platform, they need to write a script or a workflow that tells the cloud orchestration tool what to do in each step, such as creating a virtual machine, installing software, and then configuring settings

##### 1. Provision a server on a public cloud service
##### 2. Configure the network settings and security policies
##### 3. Install the required software and dependencies
##### 4. Deploy an application on the server
##### 5. Start the server and monitor its performance

###### - Imperative cloud orchestration gives a developer control and flexibility over the process, but it also requires more knowledge and skills to write and maintain the scripts or workflows
###### - Developers will also need to update the orchestration whenever there are changes in the cloud environment or the application requirements
###### - The imperative method can provide you with distinct benefits if your deployment approach calls for it. Consider these two advantages. 

###### ==> Control: By using the imperative approach, you have more control over the process. When deploying a new service, more control can help you ensure things go the way you intend. 
###### ==> Specific steps: When deploying a new service, you might want to create very specific steps so you are sure the service does exactly what you want it to do

### The declarative orchestration method
###### - Another way to achieve cloud orchestration is by using a declarative method
###### - For this, developers specify the desired outcome or goal of their cloud service, such as the configuration, performance, availability, security, and cost
###### - But, developers don’t need to write detailed instructions or procedures on how to achieve that outcome
###### - Instead, they rely on a cloud orchestration tool or framework like Kubernetes or Jenkins to interpret their specifications and execute the necessary operations and procedures for them

###### - A developer can deploy a web application to the cloud by:
###### ==> Defining the components of their application, such as the web server, database, load balancer, and firewall
###### ==> Specifying the properties and policies of each component, such as the number of server instances, scaling rules, access controls, and backup schedules

### Cloud orchestration automation software
###### - Developers use cloud automation to perform individual operations on components of a cloud environment, such as servers, databases, or switches

#### Automating cloud orchestration with Kubernetes
###### - Kubernetes(opens in a new tab) is a software platform that helps developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of their apps
###### - Kubernetes lets them define their app as a set of containers, which are isolated units of code that can run on any machine
###### - Developers can also specify how many replicas of each container they want, where the containers should run, and how they should communicate with each other

## MODULE 3: You're a cloud deployment engineer

### Your new cloud deployment engineer role

##### Your role
###### ==> your entry-level role is to provide general support for other cloud engineers to build your global company resources on the cloud

##### Your customers
###### ==> your department focuses on creating and delivering internal company software and services using the cloud

##### Your area
###### ==> you work alongside deployment and database experts to assist them in their work

#### Assignment
###### - Your first task is to assist a senior cloud deployment engineer to deploy a Docker image to the cloud using Kubernetes

#### Skills to apply
##### Technical skills
###### ==> read and write code at a fundamental level to create basic Docker and Kubernetes instructions
###### ==> run instructions from a command-line interface (CLI)

##### Testing skills
###### ==> ensure the container is properly deployed by reviewing the output in the CLI
###### ==> view the deployed application in the browser

### Your first project

#### Purpose of the project 
###### - The software development team in your company developed a small web application to help employees manage their tasks
###### - your team will deploy this application to locations all over the world to improve how well people organize and manage their time

#### Your scope of work
###### - The senior cloud engineer decides to use Kubernetes on IBM Cloud to deliver the app to employees
###### - They’ve asked you to help on the project by assisting them to configure the cluster and deploy the app image into it. The deployment works as follows.
###### ==> The Docker image you’ll deploy includes all the application files it needs to run a Node.js web server
###### ==> The container also includes three application files: script.js, style.css, and index.html.
###### ==> After you create the image and place it in the container, you’ll create a deployment file and push the image to the Kubernetes cluster using the command line.

#### Working together
###### - In this simulation, you’ll be pair programming with the senior engineer on their laptop
###### - Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together on one computer
###### - One of them, called the “driver,” writes code.
###### - The other one, called the “observer” or “navigator,” reviews each line of code, and gives feedback
###### - The two programmers frequently switch roles to share their skills and perspectives.
###### - During the simulation, you will take the role of the observer when reviewing the work of the senior engineer and the role of driver when writing code


### Simulation: Deploy a Docker container

##### Step 1
###### ==> the first step is to create a container registry on IBM Cloud
###### ==> this registry stores the Docker image you'll be creating
###### ==> by using the registry, Kubernetes has a secure place from which to find and deploy the Docker image
###### ==> after the command 'ibmcloud cr namespace-add utilities-cloud-registry', the new registry should display in the namespace list

```bash
> ibmcloud cr namespace-add utilties-cloud-registry
Successfully added namespace 'utilities-cloud-registry'
OK
> ibmcloud cr namespace-list -v
Listing namespaces for account ... in registry 'us.icr.io'...

Namespace                    Resource Group     Created
utilities-cloud-registry     Default            2 minutes ago

OK
> 
```

##### Step 2
###### ==> the next step is to build a Docker image that is ready for IBM Cloud
###### ==> the Docker image must include the operating system files that match the operating system used on IBM Cloud
###### ==> build an image for Linux

```bash
> docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t todo-app
=> => writing image
=> => naming to docker.io/library/todo-app
> 
```

##### Step 3
###### ==> it's time to create a copy of the image you just created that can be used in Kubernetes on the cloud
###### ==> you'll use the Docker tag command that will create a version of the image that Kubernetes can reference from the registry you created earlier

```bash
> docker tag todo-app:latest us.icr.io/utilities-cloud-registry/todo-app
app
> 
```

##### Step 4
###### ==> you can now push the iamge to the registry
###### ==> the Docker image is currently on the hard disk on the laptop
###### ==> for Kubernetes to be able to use it, you must push it to the registry you created earlier
###### ==> before you can push to the registry, you must give Docker permissions to communicate with IBM Cloud

```bash
> ibmcloud cr login --client docker
```

##### Step 5
###### ==> now you're ready to push the image using the Docker push command

```bash
> docker push us.icr.io/utilities-cloud-registry/todo-app
Using default tag: latest
The push refers to repository [us.icr.io/utilities-cloud-registry/todo-app]
d5a88a33ebb5: Pushed
1932e15b6e3d: Pushed
```
###### ==> the image is now in the container registry on IBM Cloud and is ready for your Kubernetes cluster to use

##### Step 6
###### ==> to deploy the app to Kubernetes, you need a special file that tells Kubernetes how to deploy the image
###### ==> create a file called app-deploy.yaml, in which you'll write the deployment 
###### ==> the file also needs to create a service on Kubernetes through which the todo app will communicate with the outside world

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata
    name: todo-app
  spec: 
    type: NodePort
    ports: 
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
    selector: 
      app: todo-app
```

##### Step 7
###### ==> next, its time to deploy the image to Kubernetes
###### ==> you'll use a command that will send the instructions in the deployment file to Kubernetes
###### ==> Kubernetes will use those instructions to make the app live on the internet

```bash
> kubectl apply -f app-deploy.yaml
deloyment.apps/todo-app created
service/todo-app unchanged
> 
```

###### ==> the app is now available on the internet and Kubernetes is delivering the app using a Docker container

##### Step 8
###### ==> before you can call the deployment a success, you must perform a test to determine if the app actually is running and available for employees to access
###### ==> to do this, you need to retreive the public IP address and a port number which you can use in a browser to test the application

```bash
> ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster mycluster-free
OK
ID                                                       Public IP        Private IP       Flavor   State
   Status    Zone    Version
kube-chd9p6sf05334n42dbi0-myclusterfr-default-00000046   169.51.206.112   10.144.222.252   free  norma
1  Ready     mil01   1.25.9_1543
```

###### ==> copy and paste the public ip in a browser window

##### Step 9
###### ==> then, you need to get the port number for the service you created

```bash
> kubectl describe service todo-app
Name: ...
Namespace: ...
Labels: ...
Annotations: ...
Selector: ...
Type: ...
IP Family Policy: ...
IP Families: ...
IP: ...
IPs: ...
Port: ...
TargetPort: ...
NodePort: <unset> 30848/TCP
Endpoints: ...
Session Affinity: ...
External Traffic Policy: ...
Events: ...
```

###### ==> copy the value for the NodePort and past that after the public IP address you pasted in the browser window with two values separated by a colon
###### 169.51.206.112:30848
###### ==> your browser will load the Node.js web application
###### ==> the application loads and you have successfully deployed it using a Docker container and Kubernetes
###### ==> notice that the app running in the container through Kubernetes appears exactly as it would if it were running on a native web server
###### ==> this is because the web server is running in a container making it easier to deploy to multiple regions or to scale as needed
