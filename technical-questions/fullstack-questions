1. I see you build a MERN application with JWT authentication. Can you walk me through how JWT works and why you chose it over other authentication methods?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a stateless authentication method where the server generates a signed token containing user information and permissions. When a user logs in, the server creates a JWT and sends it to the client. The client stores this token and includes it in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
I chose JWT because it's stateless - the server doesn't need to store session information, making it scalable for distributed systems. The token contains all necessary user information, and since it's signed, we can verify its authenticity. For our MERN application, this worked well because it allowed seamless communication between our React frontend and Express backend without requiring server-side session storage.
