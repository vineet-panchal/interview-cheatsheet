# Interet Questions

#### 1. What happens when you type in a URL

- First, the browser contacts a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address that identifies the actual server
- Then, the browser establishes a TCP connection with the server using a “three-way handshake”, which confirms both sides are ready to communicate
- Then your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, including the specific page you want, your browser type, and other headers
- Then the web server receives your request, processes it and prepares a response
- Your browser then parses the HTML, downloads all resources including images, or scripts, and renders the complete webpage on the screen
