# Introduction To Springboot

- think of springboot as a layer on top of spring that takes care of all the tedious setup for you
- it simplifies spring development by providing sensible defaults and ready-to-use features

## Getting Started

1. First, you need the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK)

[Java Downloads - Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

```bash
> java -version
> openjdk version "21.0.2" 2024-01-16  
> OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.2+13-58)  
> OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.2+13-58, mixed mode, sharing)
```

2. Next, you need to install Maven Apache, which is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects
