# Introduction to Spring

- The spring framework is used to build Java applications, it is a toolbox for building applications

### Spring Modules

- the spring framework comes with modules, each designed to handle a specific task
- these modules are broadly categorized into a few different layers
- spring is modular, meaning you can pick and choose the modules you want to use for your project

#### The Core Layer

- modules for handling dependency injection, and managing objects

#### The Web Layer

- modules for building web applications
- with these modules we can handle web requests, process data, and return responses

#### The Data Layer

- modules for working with databases

#### The Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) Layer

- module for adding cross cutting features like logging or security without cluttering the main code

#### The Test Layer

- module for testing of spring components

### Disadvantages of Spring

- while spring is powerful and flexible, using it often involves a lot of configurations
- for example, if you want to build a web application, you might need to set up a web server, configure routing, and manage dependencies manually
